            You awaken in a circular room, unsure how you got here. Your mouth is dry, and your stomach is empty.
            The place you are isn't so much a room as just an empty space.
            Standing in what you think is the 'middle' of this dark area,
            there appear to be passages to the North, Northwest, and Northeast.
            They all appear to be the same distance away from you.
            You don't really want to go anywhere, but you can't stay here.

            As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you find yourself in tall room with stone walls.
            As your stomach growls, you see a SINGLE shining red apple on the table, tempting your hunger.
            ONE ornate, gold mirror hangs on the wall.
            When you pass the ONE mirror, you notice no reflection of your image.
            Isn’t that odd? There are SEVEN very small tools strewn across the room.

            You feel a perfect breeze and find yourself in a bright, airy room with open double doors.
            It’s an intriguing room with many curiosities and trinkets.
            You hear a rustling and turn to see a bag of live insects near a chair.
            On the bookshelf, a sparkling crystalsphere draws your gaze.
            You hear birds chirping outside, leaves softly rustling and …was that a splash?

            You hear beautiful singing in the distance. Enchanted, you follow the sound.
            You find yourself in a strange room with only a window.
            In the corner, there is a glint from a SINGLE golden hairbrush.
            Distracted, you stumble over a pile of THREE silkskeins.
            You see just a portion of ONE long, golden braid.

            You can smell the fresh straw from outside the room.
            It is a large room with TWO immense lockeddoors.
            A spindle sits in the center of the room, well worn and  situated near a sturdy stool.
            There is a ONE HUGE pile of hay completely surrounding the spindle.
            Under a tarp in the corner, there seems to be stack of FIVE goldbars.
            A stack of FOUR books lays on the floor near the spindle and stool…
            the top book reads, in gold letters, “Best Baby Names”…

            This room smells clean and damp, like it’s just been cleaned.
            Everything is in its place and very tidy.
            There is a large, comfortable chair in the corner…maybe take a rest?
            You wander through the room and see a fancy invitation opened on the table.
            Near the invitation are TWO large boxes with beautiful ball gowns inside.
            Tucked under the chair, you notice what appears to be ONE glassslipper?

            The delicious smell FOUR fresh, warm gingerbread cookies lure you into the room.
            There is a hot oven and you can feel the heat,
            but that gingerbread must be somewhere here.
            You see a small structure in the corner of the room.
            Is it a cage?  As you back away, you trip over a heavy,
            ornate chest on the floor of the room. Could it be treasure?

            You see a SINGLE bed in this room, piled high with pillows and blankets.
            A SINGLE Tea, SIX lozenges and EIGHT tissue are piled high on the nightstand.
            On the floor is a small mound of fabric…. including a SINGLE red hooded cape.
            On the table near the door, a sleepingcap in a flowery pattern.
            What is the POINT of a sleepingcap?
            On the ground near the table, you see a TWO handled basket, filled with food and NINE packages.

            This room is crowded with items and smells of leather.
            There are THREE rows of shoes lined up on the shelves along the wall.
            There are SEVEN tools on several work tables placed around the room.
            You hear some whispering from the closet.
            There is a pile of folded clothing on a table near a workbench.
            The clothing is very small sizes, for a child or…?

            This room is cozy and dim.
            There is an odd silence made eerier by the low light in the room.
            The SINGLE bed looks so comfortable, and you feel so tired.
            Those fluffy pillows look so inviting to your sleepy eyes.
            You are distracted by a lump in the corner – under a pile of clothing is an old spindle,
            it’s needle sharp and shining.
            As you sit, you find a small, wooden box…a firstaidkit?

            This room is furnished sparsely, with contents that look worn or handed down.
            There is a DOUBLE ax propped against the wall near the door.
            It smells of freshly chopped wood and a fowl?
            As your eyes adjust to the light of the room,
            you spot a large nest in the corner near the fireplace.
            It's very large, the size of NINE regular-sized.
            There is not much to see in this sparse room,
            except is that a SEVEN-pound goldenfeather….?
