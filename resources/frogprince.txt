You feel a perfect breeze and find yourself in a bright, airy room with open double doors.
It’s an intriguing room with many curiosities and trinkets.
You hear a rustling and turn to see a bag of live insects near a chair.
On the bookshelf is a sparkling crystal sphere.
You hear birds chirping outside, leaves softly rustling and …was that a splash?
