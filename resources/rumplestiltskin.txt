You can smell the fresh straw from outside the room.
It is a large room with immense locked doors.
A spindle sits in the center of the room, well worn and  situated near a sturdy stool.
There is a HUGE pile of hay completely surrounding the spindle.
Under a tarp in the corner, there seems to be stack of gold bars.
A heavy book lays on the floor near the spindle and stool….in gold letters “Best Baby Names”…
