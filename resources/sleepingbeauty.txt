This room is cozy and dim.
There is an odd silence made eerier by the low light in the room.
There is a large bed that looks so comfortable, and you feel so tired.
Those fluffy pillows look so inviting to your sleepy eyes.
You are distracted by a lump in the corner – under a pile of clothing is an old spindle,
it’s needle sharp and shining.
As you sit, you find a small, wooden box…a first aid kit?
