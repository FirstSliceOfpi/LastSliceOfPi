As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you find yourself in tall room with stone walls.
As your stomach growls, you see a shining red apple on the table, tempting your hunger.

When you pass the mirror, you notice no reflection of your image.
Isnâ€™t that odd? There are several very small tools strewn across the room.
