This room smells clean and damp, like it’s just been cleaned.
Everything is in its place and very tidy.
There is a large, comfortable chair in the corner…maybe take a rest?
You wander through the room and see a fancy invitation opened on the table.
Near the invitation are two large boxes with beautiful ball gowns inside.
Tucked under the chair, you notice what appears to be a glass slipper?
