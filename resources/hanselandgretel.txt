The delicious smell of fresh, warm gingerbread lures you into the room.
There is a hot oven and you can feel the heat,
but that gingerbread must be somewhere here.
You see a small structure in the corner of the room.
Is it a cage?  As you back away, you trip over a heavy,
ornate chest on the floor of the room. Could it be treasure?
